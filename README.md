Isn't COVID-19 just like the flu?
No, it's not.



Why are we making opensource medical equipment?
Because the rate of infection is so high, there's projections millions more will catch the virus, and the amount of cases will overwhelm the healthcare system to the point where some cases will go untreated which can lead to higher rates of mortality. There's already been a US shortage of N95 masks for the last week, the US is just now seeing outbreaks of cases and if hospital staff do not have supplies like masks to protect themselves then they too can be incapacitated by the virus, leading to higher mortality.

Workflow
----------
Research/proposal -> Design -> Print/Assemble -> Test -> Review with medical experts -> use 



Directory
------------
Keep this list to the best example for each category

Tracking Data, forecasting:

OpenSource Software:
-----------------------
John Hopkins Coronavirus COVID-19 tracker:
https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6


AI/FLIR: detect people at airports, etc. with fevers from a distance

AI/CT: researchers were able to use CT scans and AI to diagnose COVID-19 cases

OpenSource Chemistry
---------------------
"Combine in a bowl:
⅔-cup rubbing alcohol (99% isopropyl alcohol)
⅓-cup aloe vera gel.
Stir. Decant into a clean soap or pump bottle."

Testing
-------------
Several different independent people should test the latest version of an individual design before bringing a prototype to a medical expert to review it
If a medical expert says it provides utility then it should be reviewed by a legal expert and an engineer
then beyond that if a design satisfies all the above then people could potentially mass produce the solution using 3D printers or whatever else


Communication
-------------



NEEDS:
3D print operators
Scientists
Engineers
Equipment evaluators
