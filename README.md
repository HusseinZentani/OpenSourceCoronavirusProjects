Isn't COVID-19 just like the flu?
No, it's not.

Symptoms:
WHO

CDC
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html

Who is most at risk:
Immune compromised people, auto-immune, HIV
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html


"Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing."


Why are we making potentially dangerous and untested opensource medical equipment?
Because the rate of infection is so high, there's projections millions more will catch the virus, and the amount of cases will overwhelm the healthcare system to the point where some cases will go untreated which can lead to higher rates of mortality. There's already been a US shortage of N95 masks for the last week, the US is just now seeing outbreaks of cases and if hospital staff do not have supplies like masks to protect themselves then they too can be incapacitated by the virus, leading to higher mortality.

Workflow
----------
Research/proposal -> Design -> Print/Assemble -> Test -> Review with medical experts -> use 

Discussion -> CAD -> 3D printer -> Equipment Evaluator -> Medical expert -> Patient

close all dine-in restaraunts
Have a senior hour at the beginning of the day for seniors 50+ store is disinfected in the morning, seniors are most vulnerable
Practice social distancing
No gatherings of 25 or more people

OpenSource Chemistry

Medical Supplies
--------------------
Shoe Coverings

Hair Coverings

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
N95 masks offer the best protection, but they are in short supply, surgical masks can be used, but do not offer the same protection as a N95 mask

N95 Recycling:
Supposedly you can wash them with bleach in water up to 40 times to renew them, this is untested and unverified

Response to N95 Recycling: "Cheuk Kwong Ng: Don't clean and sterilize the one-time disposable 3-layer surgical mask. Any attempt to clean and steralize (streaming, UV, alcohol / bleach / soap solution) the one-time disposable 3-layer surgical mask will destroy the fibre of 3 layers as well as wear off the electrostatic attraction in the middle layer which is one of the major filteration principle of mask in addition to the physical barrier.
You can use a one-time 3-layer disposable surgical mask. If u can't get one, make a reusable cloth mask (http://diymask.site) with a piece of kitchen paper which can achieve N70 level which is protective enough for daily use"

Testing
-------------
Several different independent people should test the latest version of an individual design before bringing a prototype to a medical expert to review it
If a medical expert says it provides utility then it should be reviewed by a legal expert and an engineer
then beyond that if a design satisfies all the above then people could potentially mass produce the solution using 3D printers or whatever else

Communication
-------------
What good are open source designs when all the results and development are hidden behind logins in private groups? 

Slack channel
https://www.helpfulengineering.org/

Facebook is NOT ideal
https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensourcecovid19medicalsupplies/

use hashtags like #COVID19 or #Coronavirus when you publish designs, use descriptive keywords so other developers can find your designs.

NEEDS:
-------------
3D print operators
Scientists
Engineers
Equipment evaluators
Legal Advisors
Medical Advisors
Project Managers
Hospital Contacts/Doctors

Manufacturing:

Potential Designs, research directions:
-------------------------
Ultraviolet mask - supposedly a bad idea because UV lights create ozone which is bad for lungs

AC airfilter backpack
